    <h2>🎨Madhubani Painting - The Heartbeat of Mithila🎨</h2>
    <p>Madhubani painting, also known as Mithila art, is a world-renowned folk painting style that originated in the Mithila region of Bihar. Traditionally created by women on mud walls and floors during festivals and special occasions, this art form has now reached canvas, cloth, and even global galleries. It is known for its eye-catching geometric patterns, bold natural colors, and deep spiritual themes. Artists use twigs, fingers, and brushes to depict scenes of gods, goddesses, nature, love, and daily village life. Each painting is not just art, but a story — a reflection of Bihar's cultural pride and timeless tradition.</p>

    <h2>🐍Manjusha Art - Bhagalpur ki Rangin Virasat🐍</h2>
    <p> Manjusha Art is a traditional folk painting style from Bhagalpur, Bihar, deeply rooted in ancient legends and religious beliefs. It visually narrates the story of “Bihula and Vishahari”, a tale of devotion and courage, where a faithful wife fights to bring her husband back to life from a snakebite.

The paintings are known for their use of bright colors like pink, yellow, and green, and feature symbols such as snakes, turtles, the sun, flowers, and goddesses. Each artwork is created in a box-like structure and tells a complete story — much like a comic strip.

Originally, this art was made on bamboo baskets and paper boxes (called Manjusha), which gave the art its name. Today, it has evolved and is now created on canvas, fabric, and even walls. Manjusha Art is not just a painting style — it's a living expression of Bihar’s cultural heritage and deep spiritual faith.

    <h2>🪡 Sujini Embroidery - The Storytelling Stitch of Bihar</h2>
    <p> Sujini Embroidery is a traditional textile art from the Mithila and Muzaffarpur regions of Bihar. This craft is more than just decoration — it is a way for rural women to express their stories, struggles, dreams, and daily life through needle and thread.

The word "Sujini" comes from the Sanskrit word "Sujala" (easy birth or comfort), and the art was traditionally used to make soft quilts for newborns from old sarees and dhotis. Women would stitch meaningful patterns, gods, festivals, social issues, and even personal emotions into the fabric.
